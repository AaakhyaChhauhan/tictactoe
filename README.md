Developed a web-based Tic Tac Toe game using Java for the backend logic and HTML for the user interface. The game features a simple and responsive UI, enabling two players to play in turns. It includes input validation, win/draw detection, and a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates my skills in combining frontend markup with backend programming and managing game state efficiently.
